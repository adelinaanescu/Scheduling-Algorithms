# App Deployment on the Decentralized Cloud

### Description

I developed a simulation platform to test the performance of multiple task scheduling algorithms in a peer-to-peer network.

### Instructions

- Install Python. Check with `python -version` in the command prompt.
- Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- Create a new directory and clone the project.
- Make sure that the directory for the python bin/ folder are included in your $PATH environment variable.
- Run the following command, be sure you are in the correct folder: `python scheduler.py`


#### Note: The dataset used in the simulation is downloaded from Google cluster-usage traces database from 2011. See documentation [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R0dkzj9NUzwwjoRoXbQvrue3Yp3QZ3zR/view?usp=sharing).
